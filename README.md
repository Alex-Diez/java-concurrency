# Project

This is a repo with source code of solutions of different concurrent tasks.
Main source of tasks is ["The art of multiprocessor programming"]
(http://www.amazon.com/The-Multiprocessor-Programming-Revised-Reprint/dp/0123973376)
Some tasks are found in net using google. All tasks could be changed by me
to make it more complicated. That's it.
